What process aspects will be changed? Why?
    Follow the TDD requirements more strictly. Specifically, we will create tests in the correct file directory, since we lost points for creating the test files in the incorrect directory.	
    Make branches follow Gitflow naming requirements
    We will try to have our work done earlier so we can get help from our peers on getting cobertura coverage.

What tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review feedback?
    We will combine our pages into one dashboard.
    We will create a stock popup on the dashboard that will add stocks to be viewed or to be added to the users portfolio.
    Remove search feature.
    Set banner to a certain hex value.
    Add adjustable dates on the graph.
    Add acceptance tests for all buttons.
