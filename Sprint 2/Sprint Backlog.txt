During our sprint planning meeting, we chose to assign each of the broader features (1-4) and a general home page to a team member. Since we had 
people researching how to implement these features in the last sprint, each team member has a better idea of what exactly needs to get done to 
complete them. Requirements 5-8 must also be considered when we are developing features 1-4, so we have included them in our backlog. Additionally, 
we will be going back and fixing an error in our sign up feature.

Meeting participants: Sarah Cheung, Kendall Mayo, Nandhakumar Saravana, Jackson Sun, Navid Zaman
