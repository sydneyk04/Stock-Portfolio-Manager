What process aspects will be changed? Why?
•	Since we got points off for TDD, we will follow the TDD steps (e.g. shell methods and unit tests) more strictly.
•	Due to many unexpected merge conflicts and issues on the master and develop branch, we will work more closely together through group Zoom meetings.
•	We will also focus more time on creating and passing both unit and acceptance tests, because several of them were unimplemented or failing.

What tasks will be added to the product backlog as a result of review
feedback?
•	Ability to add or remove stocks from the portfolio
•	Track and visualize changes in value over time of user’s portfolio
•	View and compare the historical performance of a stock
•	Works on the Chrome web browser and mobile devices
•	The application must be secure and protect confidentiality of users’ data
