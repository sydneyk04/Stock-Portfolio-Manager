What process aspects will be changed? Why?

● Double-check that our documentation requirements are met, because we missed some requirements and one scrum meeting’s video link wasn’t working.

● Instead of requiring one reviewer to approve a PR, we will require two reviewers' approvals before merging it. In Sprint 1, there were errors in the develop branch because a reviewer did not catch a bug in the PR sometimes.

● We will have a more strict schedule for assigned tasks, instead of flexible deadlines. At the end of Sprint 1, we were scrambling a little bit to get everything successfully merged to the master branch without any bugs. And we will make sure everyone has at least one task in progress.

● We will follow the TDD rules more strictly. In Sprint 1, we wrote tests after implementation.
