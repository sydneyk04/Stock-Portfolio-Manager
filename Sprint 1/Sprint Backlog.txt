During the sprint planning meeting, we discussed the complexity of each feature. Since the home, login, and signup pages are more basic features compared to the others, we decided to start with those for the first sprint. For the other five features, we plan to research ways to implement them first before adding them to to future sprint backlogs.

Meeting participants: Sarah Cheung, Kendall Mayo, Nandhakumar Saravana, Jackson Sun
